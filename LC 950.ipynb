    "We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.\n",
    "After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.\n",
    "We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].\n",
    "We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].\n",
    "We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].\n",
    "We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].\n",
    "We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].\n",
    "We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].\n",
    "We reveal 17.\n",
    "Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.\n",
